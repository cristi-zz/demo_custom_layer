# Adding a custom layer in PyTorch
I have this brilliant idea, a way to transform input data to output data, that will inject so much inductive bias
into my network that the problem I am dealing with, will become trivial to learn, for a NN!

Excellent! How do we do that? How to derive a custom layer in PyTorch? We need the forward and backward code for it! 
But do we really need the backward step, too?

## Setup

Use anaconda to create the env

conda create -y --copy -c pytorch -n demo-layer python=3.9.2 numpy pytest matplotlib jupyterlab ipywidgets ipympl pytorch=1.12.0 cudatoolkit=10.2
